## Description

Prescription utilizes the Cloudinary API and it's widget functionality to allow users to upload photos/videos from their computer, a webpage, Google Drive, Dropbox, Facebook, Instagram or Shutterstock. The image can then be compressed and manipulated with the click of a button.  
<br>
Current image manipulations include: Instagram-esque filter effects, facial blurring (of one or multiple faces), and image scaling with the user's chosen dimensions. Current video manipulations include: video trimming (from beginning and/or end), slow motion effect, video scaling with the user's chosen dimensions, and the ability to convert a video to a GIF. Additionally, the user can specify the returned file type (.svg, .png, and .svg for images/.mov and .mp4 for video).

### API Security  
* Create a ```.env``` file in the root directory of the project.***
  * Copy the cloud name, API key, API secret, and preset name from your Cloudinary account and paste into your ```.env``` file, but please note the example below does not contain real or valid information:

***A ```.env``` file along with the ```dotenv-webpack``` will keep your API key secure. [Read more about API key security](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/asynchrony-and-apis/managing-api-keys).
