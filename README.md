## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the repository with the following git terminal command: ```$ git clone https://github.com/BrianSturgis/JanTeamWeek.git```
* Open the project directory in your terminal
* Confirm you have installed [Node](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/getting-started-with-javascript/installing-node-js) and [Node Package Manager](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/test-driven-development-and-environments-with-javascript/building-a-manifest-file-with-npm) 
* Go to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to sign up for a free account. This will allow you to acquire a cloud name, API key, and API secret (can be through your account dashboard)
  * In your Cloudinary account, go to settings -> Upload -> Upload Presets
  * From the signing mode dropdown, select unsigned and then save the preset:

* Create a ```.env``` file in the root directory of the project.***
  * Copy the cloud name, API key, API secret, and preset name from your Cloudinary account and paste into your ```.env``` file, but please note the example below does not contain real or valid information:

* Create the production environment by running the terminal command: ```$ npm run build```

***A ```.env``` file along with the ```dotenv-webpack``` will keep your API key secure. [Read more about API key security](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/intermediate-javascript/asynchrony-and-apis/managing-api-keys).
